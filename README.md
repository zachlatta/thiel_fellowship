# Thiel Fellowship Application

Thank you for your interest in applying. We hope that this process helps you to
think fully about your future and encourages you to move forward on your
project. All applications are due by midnight, December 31 of the application
year. If you have any questions about the process or need assistance, please
email Allyson Dias (adias@thielfoundation.org).

**1. Fellowship Project Vision and Description**

**Essay**

For the following question, please write an original essay. We prefer quality
over quantity. If you are part of a team, the whole team should collaborate on
a single essay for this section, and each member should paste that essay into
his or her application.

**In an essay below, tell us how you would like to change the world, how you
would personally make this change happen in a project, and how you would like
to use the Thiel Fellowship to pursue this vision. Please address all three
parts.**

I believe we'll remember the 21st century as the rise of the internet. The
internet is changing the course of humanity forever. It has completely
revolutionized the concept of information. Never before has there been a
neutral platform for ideas truly by the people, for the people. Each and every
day the internet brings us, as a species, closer, making the previously
far-fetched idea of peaceful globalization a reality. We live in the
Information Age, yet only one in ten American high schools teaches computer
science. We are doing a disservice to our students, to this next generation,
by not giving them the opportunity to succeed in this world driven by
technology. 

It's extremely difficult to make change in schools. There are districts,
teachers, budgets, and countless other obstacles getting in the way of change.
I'm a big fan of a program called Key Club. Key Club provides students the
tools and resources needed to start successful student-run volunteering clubs
in high schools all around the country. Key Club works because all it takes is
a **single student** to start a successful program. I gave this a lot of
thought last year and ended up starting a computer science club at my high
school. Throughout the course of the school year I taught approximately 20 of
my peers the fundamentals of programming. Seeing members go from a passive
interest in computers to changing the world through technology was very
empowering and made me want to bring my club to the world. I am doing this
through hackEDU. HackEDU is Key Club for computer science. We provide students
the tools and resources they need to successfully bootstrap computer science
programs at their schools. Like Key Club, hackEDU works because all it takes is
a **single student** to bring a computer science program into a school. It
doesn't take any dealing with districts, teachers, or budgets, just a single
student going out of their way.

I'd like to change the world by giving every student the opportunity to learn
computer science. I am confident that hackEDU is the ideal catalyst for this.
I believe that, through hackEDU, I can start a student-driven
movement, bringing computer science programs to schools throughout the world.
Participating in the Thiel Fellowship would allow hackEDU to spread far quicker
than ever before. We'd be able to pilot our program in low-income communities
sooner than ever imagined. Poverty is a ruthless, endless cycle. Bringing computer
science curriculum to low-income schools would create opportunities for those
who have none.

I am very excited for the future of hackEDU as a movement. I'm hoping we'll
change some lives.

**2. Project Timeline - Two Sentence Pitch**

Please write two sentences for each of the following questions based on your
essay above.

**What do you want to accomplish in the next 10 years?**

Within the next 10 years, I'd like to bring computer science to 60% of high
school students in the United States. I truly believe that hackEDU is capable
of starting a movement that will make this a reality.

**What do you want to accomplish in the next 2 years?**

I'd like to implement a hack club in at least 20 high schools within the next 2
years. Depending on how successful our initial pilot goes, we'll see how
realistic this is.

**What do you plan to accomplish in the next 3 months?**

We currently have two high schools lined up for our initial pilot starting in
mid-January. I'm excited to see what kinds of challenges we run into and what
we can do to mitigate them.

**Optional: What did you do in the last year to advance your cause?**

Last year I started a computer science club at my high school and taught ~20
students computer science as a proof-of-concept. Incorporating what I learned,
I turned it into hackEDU and partnered with a similar nonprofit for curriculum,
applied to Y-Combinator (got an interview for the S14 batch), and registered as
a nonprofit organization.

**3. What experience and expertise do you have to execute on the project that
you want to do?**

As a current high school student, I relate directly with the needs of the users
of our program. I'm familiar with many of the challenges our users will face
because I've already faced them myself.

Additionally, I have an extensive background in working on successful projects,
both online and off. This past year I worked on Football Heroes, an arcade
football game for mobile devices. We launched this past November and already
have over 800,000 downloads. We've been featured on iTunes and prominent
publications, including TouchArcade and GameInformer. We currently have over
4500 reviews and have been in top 5 free apps in the App Store.

This past year I've participated in seven hackathons and learned how important
working with people is.

About a month ago I participated in the Virtual Piggy 2013 hackathon. I created
Bitroad, an online bitcoin marketplace and won the grand prize in my age group
of over $15,000. Bitroad made it to the front page of Hacker News and currently
has over 90 stars on GitHub.

At PennApps Fall 2013 I created texit, a LaTeX API. It was a top 20 hack and
was selected to be presented to over 1000 people, including the founders of
RapGenius, Codecademy, and notable venture capitalists. It later made it to the
front page of Hacker News and currently has over 200 stars on GitHub.

When I entered high school, I was disappointed by the lack of a computer
science program. Instead of [settling for nothing], I created my own program. I
stared a computer science club where I taught approximately 20 of my peers the
fundamentals of programming. Seeing them go from a passive interest in
computers to changing the world with their skillset was very empowering and
made me want to bring my club to the world. I'm doing this through hackEDU.

This past year I've been working as a software developer on Football Heroes.
Watching it develop from a proof-of-concept to a market-ready product served as
an enormous learning experience. The most important lesson I learned from the
entire ordeal is that bringing a product to market is rarely an engineering
problem, but rather, fundamentally, a people problem. Being able to work with
others is far more important than being able to design the most robust systems
or having the most optimized code.

In addition to Football Heroes, I started leading development on Grasp this
past June. Grasp is an open-source Common Core learning management system
created for Loyola Marymount University. Working with others, both technical
and nontechnical, made me realize how difficult being an effective leader
actually is. This was around the same time I read How to Win Friends and
Influence People, by Dale Carnegie. As I read, I had the opportunity to apply
what I was reading in a project that actually mattered. I truly believe that
this was very defining of the leader I am today.

At the beginning of my freshman year of high school, I started a computer
science club where I taught my peers the fundamentals of programming. I learned
that while students definitely have an interest in learning to program, they
don't always necessarily have the opportunity. I also noticed that many
students seemed to use the club as an outlet - somewhere to temporarily escape
the countless struggles of high school. Despite considering the club a success,
I feel like many things were holding us back from getting to the next level.
One of our biggest issues was the lack of a consistent curriculum. This
contributed to our biggest problem of lack of consistency. Many days were very
successful, but just as many weren't. The lack of consistency prevented us from
establishing a trajectory for progress throughout the year. One of my primary
goals with hackEDU is to mitigate these issues as much as possible.

**Essay**

For the following question, please write an original essay. We prefer quality
over quantity. If you are applying as a team, each applicant should write about
a different belief.

**9. Tell us one thing about the world that you strongly believe is true, but
that most people think is false. If this belief shapes the way you live, tell
us how.**

I strongly believe that education extends far beyond what is taught in school.
Far too often I find my peers pigeonholing math to what happens in
pre-calculus, language to what happens in English 10, and science to what
happens in their chemistry class. I strongly believe that education can be a
mixing pot of knowledge, drawing connections between math and language, science
and the arts, truly creating an intricate nexus of connections.

This philosophy has shaped my life ever since I was very young. It inspired me
to learn programming, to start businesses, and to learn from others. It
motivated me to begin my computer science major in the 8th grade, to get
involved in hackathons around the nation, and to connect with others all over
the world. Most importantly, it taught me to never stop learning.

I also believe that this philosophy doesn't need to stop at my life, it could
be brought to the world. I like to imagine a world where everyone is excited to
learn. Where learning doesn't stop at school and isn't done for grades, but
rather self-improvement.

**Short Answer Section**

**10. Tell us about a risk you have taken or a challenge you have faced. Tell
us whether you failed or succeeded, how you behaved, and how you think this
reflects your character.**

In the third grade I started a lemonade stand with one of my friends. We sold
lemonade and cookies outside the local middle school. We were overwhelmed by
the demand and were often making a net upwards of $30 each day.

One day the city police paid us a visit. They said that we could no longer
continue operating because we lacked health inspections and were making more
than the city minimum for unregistered businesses.

Instead of giving up, my father and I went directly to city hall and spoke
to the city manager. We went back and forth between the city and police,
hearing conflicting things from both parties.

As it turns out, a mother of a local middle school student called her son's
school worried that our lemonade stand had malicious intent. Since the school
was responsible for all students until they arrived home, they called the
police just in case.

The process of working with the city and middle school was a tremendous
learning experience. Most notably, I learned how to work around bureaucracy to
make things happen.

**11. Tell us about a time when you created an opportunity or connection for
yourself that did not previously exist. Share about your experience and the
outcome of creating this opportunity or connection.**

I entered high school looking forward to having teachers genuinely excited
about what they were teaching. I was excited to move from learning for tests
into learning the concepts beyond. Unfortunately, my freshman year proved to be
a massive letdown. The coursework didn't interest me, my teachers weren't
teaching beyond the tests, and the extreme focus on grades was utterly and
completely demoralizing. It was extremely difficult to balance learning on my
own and learning within the bounds of my public high school. I made it out of
my freshman year with good grades, but I wasn't satisfied.

I started my sophomore year hoping for a better year and a lot of different.
Unfortunately, I just found much more of the same. Balancing large loads of
schoolwork with traveling around the nation for different events proved very
difficult and ended up putting a lot more stress on me.

I decided that it was time for some change. This past October I switched out
from my local public high school into the district's online program. The
courses are accredited on the same level as my old high schools', but I now
have much more flexibility in my schedule. In these past three months, I've
been able to accomplish more than I have in the past year. I started working
heavily on hackEDU, I applied to Y-Combinator, we launched Football Heroes, I
won the Virtual Piggy hackathon, I started work on Grasp 2.0, and, most
importantly, I've been happier than ever.

Instead of letting my old high school defeat me, I took advantage of the system
and created an opportunity for myself. I've grown remarkably these past few
months and I am incredibly optimistic for the future.
