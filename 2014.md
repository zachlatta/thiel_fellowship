**What do you want to work on over the next 2 years?**

I started a programming club at my high school last year because we didn't have
any computer science courses. Over the course of the year, spending an hour
each week, I helped 15 students learn programming. Near the end of the year,
something interesting happened: students started to build things. A group of
three students built an Android game without prior Java experience. One of
those students taught himself fractals by implementing them in JavaScript and,
today, he continues to use programming as a learning tool in the classroom.
Another student discovered his love for web development, landing his first
client when Summer vacation started. Last February, I brought him to the LAUNCH
hackathon with me, where his team got 3rd place and $33,000 in investment.

After observing initial success with the club, and after seeing other students
around the nation start clubs for the same reasons I did, I started hackEDU.
HackEDU is a nonprofit organization that helps high school students start and
lead programming clubs at their schools. We help students get their clubs off
the ground, connect them to sponsors, and build a global community of students
teaching other students how to code.

**Why spend your time on this?**

Most computer science education initiatives run into one of two problems: (1)
they simply don't have the distribution to reach a majority of students in the
world, or (2) the quality of the programs are low. With hackEDU, there is an
opportunity to reach millions of students and have a substantial impact on
individuals using a data-driven approach. Lots of people try to improve
education, but few realize it is actually an execution-intensive endeavor. 

Using my first programming club as a minimum viable product, I learned how
students can teach other students programming. This past semester, I ran a
pilot program with 7 schools across 6 states to learn more about scaling an
effective computer science club.

I'm now at a point in my life where I'm in the best possible position to
continue iterating on the model and, once ready, to scale it to millions of
students.  As a member of the target audience, I have established myself as a
leader. I run a community of nearly 2,000 high school developers and leaders in
the hackathon community[0]. Over the past six months alone, I organized three
high school hackathons, helped organize one of the largest hackathons on the
West Coast, and been to nine hackathons total (as a mentor to four of them).

**Do you have any collaborators or cofounders? If yes, who are they?**

I have a team of volunteers in addition to a small mentor network that I've
assembled, in part, through the Fellowship community.

**Do you know anyone in our community? If yes, who? Have you been part of any
other incubator or entrepreneurship programs? If so, which ones?**
